# **RemindMe App**  

A full-stack reminder and task management app created with **Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, Clerk authentication, React Hook Form, ShadCN UI, and Tailwind CSS.** This project is based on a structured lesson, however it has been enlarged and refactored to underline important principles in modern full-stack programming.

## Why Does This Project Matter?
This project provided a good opportunity to improve my grasp of Next.js 14's server components, authentication routines with Clerk, and database interactions with Prisma ORM. Implementing server actions, real-time UI updates, and form validation gave me valuable hands-on experience with scalable web application architecture.
